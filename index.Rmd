# 1. Yet another Intro to Computational Social Science

---

## *Computational* in Computational Social Science
It can have three meanings:

- **Digital**<br> 
Based on large datasets of human behavior, for example produced by the Web and social media

- **Computerized**<br>
The quantitative analysis of data in an automated, tractable, repeatable, and extensible fashion

- **Generative**<br>
Application of data and results to design of agent-based models that explain complex social phenomena and motivate interventions

- A **complicated system** has many pieces with specific functions and well-defined relationships. It has been carefully **engineered or designed**.  
- A **complex system** is composed of many particles that interact following some forces or dynamics. Its behavior follows from **natural principles**.

## The Social Function of Collective Emotions

<center>
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=900}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/ColectiveEmotions.png")
```
</center>

- **Theory of collective effervescence (Durkheim, 1912):**
Shared emotions generate social identity, reinforce shared beliefs, and lead to higher solidarity

- **Collective emotions (von Scheve and Salmela, 2014):**   
Emotional states shared by a large amount of people at the same time

## Linguistic Signals

**Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, LIWC (pronounced “Luke”)**  
- Simple word matching method  
- Validated by psychologists, years of implementation (2001-2015)  
- Multiple classes, calibrated for netspeak and neologisms

- Strong difference after the attacks
- Difference lasts for months

]

---

## What we learned about collective emotions

- Terrorist attacks trigger collective emotions that we can observe online

- Terms related to social resilience increase after collective emotions

- Individuals expressing stronger emotions used on average more terms related to social processes, prosocial behavior, and shared values

- Collective emotions are not just venting, they can keep us together

- Negative effects: inter-group conflict, intolerance, short-term orientation...

- Online interactive visualization at: http://dgarcia.eu/ParisAttacks.html

## State-of-the-practice Sentiment Analysis Pipeline

.left-column[
![](figures/SA-pipeline.png)
]

.right-column[
1. Create representative sample of documents from application case
2. Crowdsource annotations (e.g. Mechanical Turk, FigureEight, students...)
3. Split development/training/test samples from annotated documents
4. Develop model using the development sample, evaluate on training sample with cross-validation
5. Train final model on full train sample
6. One evaluation run over test sample. Report performance versus a benchmark including other models and methods
7. Apply model over rest of documents

# Challenges in Emotion Identification

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=950, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/communication.png")
```

Current sentiment analysis approaches assume that the **ground truth** is an annotation of emotions by **a reader**, often a student or a crowdsourcing worker

Noise in ground truth creates **unmeasured error** and potential biases

# Out-Of-Domain Datasets

- We gathered datasets of emotion annotations from previous research
- We use only test samples to allow future benchmarks
- enISEAR and UniversalJoy are reader-annotated. TEC similarly with \#-tags
- Affection not present in OOD datasets
- Not a hard test of generalizability but a way to explore other domains

## Simulated networks with renaming interface

.center[![:scale 100%](figures/LLMnetC.png)]

- Random renaming between rounds: keeping node ids but changing names
- Token prior effect reduced: no degree info leads to narrow degree distribution
- We can model online network growth but we need to consider these are language models -- future models should include behavioral tokens

# 6. The Scale of Coordination among AI Agents


---
# LLMs Within Society

.center[![:scale 88%](figures/AIeverywhere.png)]
- AI "chiefs of staff" promise to interact with each other in our behalf
- Coordination and competition (reservations, negotiations, applications)
- **Could norms emerge, for example rules to be more efficient?** 
- **Could they have systemic risks, like flash crashes?**

---

# The Social LLM Hypothesis
.pull-left[![:scale 100%](figures/DunbarQuestion.svg)]
.pull-right[

- Group formation and sustainability: size depends on cognitive ability


- Memory of identity to predict behavior and cooperation


- Language as a tool for humans to make larger groups:
  - Dunbar's number (150-250)

- **Do AI agents form stable groups and are they limited by their linguistic abilities?**

# Coordination and Critical Group Size

.center[![:scale 80%](figures/Fish.png)]

Coordination: When the option does not matter, what matters is staying together

# Coordination Dynamics in LLM Agents
.pull-left[.center[![:scale 75%](figures/OP.png)]]
.pull-right[
- Simulation of a tight group of N interacting agents
- Agents start with a random opinion of two options
- Each iteration, they see the opinions of all others (prompt)
- They respond to the question of their opinion
- Opinion labels need to be random and shuffled to avoid token biases
- Consensus is achieved if all have the same opinion
- No incentive or instruction to follow the majority

# LLM-Dependent Consensus Formation
.center[![:scale 75%](figures/Consensus.png)]
Some LLMs can reach consensus for completely arbitrary decisions (50 agents)

---

# Understanding LLM Opinion Dynamics

.center[![:scale 94%](figures/Sigma.png)]
Agent opinion changes follow an S-function parametrized by a majority force $\beta$
---

# Majority Force Factors
.center[![:scale 95%](figures/plot2.png)]
- Majority force is higher for models with higher language understanding capabilities (MMLU benchmark)
- Majority force decreases for larger group sizes

---
## Critical Group Size and Consensus Time $T_c$
.pull-right[![:scale 100%](figures/CW.png)]

- Analysis of critical group size $N_c$


- $N>N_c$: time to consensus $T_c$ grows exponentially with $N$


- Above critical size, consensus is unfeasible and happens only by chance


- $T_c$ can be calculated from $\beta$ as in an Ising Model (i.e. time to magnetization as a function of inverse temperature)

- $N_c$ can be derived from  $\beta$ as the point of phase transition of $T_c$ ( $\beta_c=1$ )


---

# Group Size and Language Understanding
.pull-right[![:scale 90%](figures/Scaling.png)]

- Analysis of majority force and exhaustive simulations to measure **critical consensus size**

- Exponential function of MMLU benchmark

- Humans close to the line

- GPT4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet reach consensus for $N=1000$
  - LLM emergent consensus scale beyond humans


---

# Summary of last part

- An idea: Improving Agent-Based Modelling with generative agents (LLMs)
- Generative agents can create realistic social network degree distributions
- LLM consensus scale predicted by language understanding capabilities
- LLMs can reach emergent consensus at scales beyond humans
- **Opportunity: decision-making or coordination?**
- **Risk: undesired synchronization like a flash crash?**
- **Future: Social simulation with LLMs **
